    // at how it is defined.
    //
    //print_difference( ... );   // Uncomment and finish this line


    // 2. We want to use the `print_array` function to print coords...but coords isn't an array!
    // Create an array of type [f32; 2] and initialize it to contain the
    // information from coords.  Uncomment the print_array line and run the code.

    // `cargo run` will produce the additional output "Lights are on!" I'll get you started:
    //
    //on_off(mess.2 ...);

    // 5.  What a mess -- functions in a binary! Let's get organized!
    //
    // - Make a library file (src/lib.rs)
    // - Move all the functions (except main) into the library
    // - Make all the functions public with `pub`
    // - Bring all the functions into scope using use statements. Remember, the name of the library
    //   is defined in Cargo.toml.  You'll need to know that to `use` it.
    //
    // `cargo run` should produce the same output, only now the code is more organized. 🎉

    // Challenge: Uncomment the line below, run the code, and examine the
    // output. Then go refactor the print_distance() function according to the
    // instructions in the comments inside that function.

    // print_distance(coords);
